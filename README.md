## Explanation
- This project is pretty much me learning to code and work with financial data
- Thus, the code is quite messy and definitely not the best
- However the project is quite cool
- main.py takes all options contracts from Deribit (largest crypto options exchange) and calculates total naive gamma exposure and the gamma distribution. 
- Further work would work on calculating Vanna exposure and make more realistic assumptions then naive gamma distribution
- Don't judge my code too hard, this was really one of my first real coding projects :)
